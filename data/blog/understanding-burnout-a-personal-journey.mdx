Burnout is a term that seems almost ubiquitous in our fast-paced world, yet its true weight is difficult to comprehend until you've felt it yourself.
I didn't understand what I was going through until I came across a YouTube video that described [occupational burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout) and how to deal with it.
In sharing my experience I hope to offer a sense of comfort and direction to others facing the same battle.

## Falling into Burnout

It began subtly with a slow drain of enthusiasm. I started feeling disconnected from the tasks that I once loved, and, before long, almost everything I did felt empty.    
The main culprit? Job-related pressures and setbacks which included the likes of:
* Limited career progression with no promotions on the horizon.
* Frustration from seeing my ideas getting overlooked or dismissed.
* Lack of acknowledgment of my hard work and contributions.
* The demoralizing feedback that I was "replaceable" in my role.

Some of these things should be common sense like the replaceable bit, we all are.    
Others like seeing no promotions despite my hard work slowly started eating at me. Heck, people with far less experience than me are now my managers.    
Everything built up over the course of two years and now I am at my lowest.

## Finding a Way Out

The first step is to recognize that there is indeed a problem. Once I admitted to myself that I was dealing with burnout, I began looking for a way to overcome and recover.    
Here are a few things that are helping me in my recovery:

### 1. Taking a Step Back

I realized I needed to take a step back from the constant pressures of work to regain some perspective. This involved setting boundaries, taking breaks when necessary, and allowing myself to recharge without guilt.    
Creating a little distance helped me see the bigger picture and reduced the overwhelming feeling that had built up over time.

### 2. Recording My Wins

I started taking into account my achievements and realized that I have done quite a bit this year.    
Simply keeping track of whatever meaningful contributions I've made has helped me counter the negative self-talk that often comes with burnout.

### 3. Trying New Things

To break the cycle of mental exhaustion, I started actively pursuing new experiences. 
Whether it's learning a new skill, picking up a different hobby, or just switching up my routine, these fresh activities bring a sense of renewal and offer a much-needed escape from the monotony that fed my burnout.

### 4. Leaning on Others

One of the most helpful steps has been opening up to those I trust. 
Sharing my struggles with family members has been incredibly therapeutic. 
Just being heard, without necessarily expecting solutions, reminds me of the importance of human connection and how vital it is for our well-being.

### 5. Put It Down on Paper

I started blogging and journaling regularly as a way to process my thoughts and feelings. 
Writing it all down has been incredibly therapeutic, allowing me to release the stress that builds up inside and organize my thoughts.    
Blogging has also provided a sense of connection, as sharing my journey makes me feel less alone and helps others who might be going through similar experiences.

## Key Takeaways

I might still be dealing with burnout but some valuable lessons I have learned are:
* **Self-awareness is essential.** Recognizing burnout signs early can prevent a deeper decline.
* **It's okay to not be okay.** Admitting to struggles isn't weakness; it's the first step toward healing.
* **Small steps matter.** Recovery is gradual, and even small positive actions make a difference.
* **Connection matters.** Isolation can worsen burnout, while reaching out provides perspective and support.

## Moving Forward

As I continue down the path of recovery, I'm learning to be gentler with myself. 
Burnout isn't a personal failure, it's often the result of prolonged stress and challenging circumstances. 
By sharing my experience, I hope to encourage a more open conversation about mental health, especially in the workplace.

If you're facing burnout, remember you're not alone. Reach out, seek support, and give yourself time to heal. 
The road to recovery may be uneven, but with patience and self-compassion, it's possible to rediscover joy and purpose in life.

# Web APIs Presentation

## Introduction (2-3 minutes)
- Welcome and introduce yourself
- Brief overview of what APIs are and why they matter
- "Today we'll explore RESTful API design principles and best practices for working with APIs"

## RESTful API Design Principles (10-15 minutes)

### Core REST Principles
- **Resource-Based**: Everything is a resource with a unique URI
  - Example: `/users`, `/users/123`, `/users/123/posts`
  
- **Representations**: Resources can have multiple formats (JSON, XML)
  - Show JSON example of a user resource

- **Statelessness**: Each request contains all needed information
  - Benefits: Reliability, scalability, visibility

- **Uniform Interface**: Standard HTTP methods
  - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
  - Explain what each does with examples

- **Caching**: Responses define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
  - Show example headers: `Cache-Control`, `ETag`

### Examples of Well-Designed RESTful APIs
- GitHub API: Clear resource hierarchy, consistent HTTP methods
- Stripe API: Intuitive naming, versioning, detailed errors
- Twitter API: Rate limiting, OAuth, pagination

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger)
- Benefits: Machine-readable, interactive, standardized
- Show a simple OpenAPI example
- Mention documentation tools: Swagger UI, ReDoc, Stoplight

## Working with APIs (10-15 minutes)

### API Authentication and Authorization
- **API Keys**: Simple tokens in headers/query params
  - Pros: Easy to implement, low overhead
  - Cons: Limited security, difficult to manage at scale
  - Show example header: `X-API-Key: abc123def456ghi789`

- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework for third-party access
  - Flow types: Authorization Code, Implicit, Client Credentials, Resource Owner
  - Walk through basic OAuth flow (5 steps)

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Compact, self-contained tokens
  - Structure: Header, payload, signature
  - Show example JWT

### Common API Integration Challenges

- **Error Handling**
  - Use standard HTTP status codes
  - Include error codes and messages
  - Show example error response

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Strategies: Fixed window, sliding window, token bucket
  - How to handle: Monitor headers, implement backoff, cache
  - Show example rate limit headers

- **Versioning**
  - Strategies: URL path, query parameter, header, content negotiation
  - Examples of each approach

- **Pagination**
  - Approaches: Offset-based, cursor-based, time-based
  - Show example pagination response

## Best Practices for API Design (5 minutes)
1. Use nouns, not verbs in endpoints
2. Use plural resource names
3. Use nested resources for relationships
4. Implement HATEOAS
5. Use proper status codes
6. Provide filtering, sorting, and field selection

## Resources for Further Learning (2 minutes)
- REST API Tutorial (restfulapi.net)
- OpenAPI Specification
- OAuth 2.0 Simplified
- API Design Patterns
- RESTful API Design: Best Practices

## Q&A Session (10-15 minutes)
- Prepare for common questions:
  - REST vs SOAP
  - When to use GraphQL
  - API security beyond authentication
  - Best versioning approaches
  - Handling long-running operations

## Presentation Tips
- Use visual examples where possible
- Include real-world API examples
- Consider live demos of API calls using tools like Postman
- Provide code snippets for common API interactions
- Allow time for questions throughout, not just at the end
